# -SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-with-Python
Project Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify sonar returns into either "Rocks" or "Mines". The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a logistic regression model is used to make predictions. Below are the key tasks and implementation details.

Features and Functionality

1. Data Preprocessing

Splitting Data: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets with 90% for training and 10% for testing.

test_size=0.1: Ensures 10% of data is used for testing.

Stratify: The data is split based on the distribution of the classes (Rocks and Mines) to maintain balance in both training and test sets.

Random State: Provides a consistent pattern for reproducibility during the data split.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Displaying the first 5 rows of the dataset.

Fetching the number of rows and columns.

Generating statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, min, max, etc.

Counting the total number of "Rocks" and "Mines" in the dataset.

Separating Features and Labels: The data is separated into input features and their corresponding labels for modeling purposes.

2. Model Training

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is trained using the training data to learn the patterns and relationships within the sonar data.

Data Preparation:

The input data is converted into a NumPy array for compatibility with the model.

For single-instance predictions, the NumPy array is reshaped accordingly.

3. Model Evaluation

Testing:

The model is tested on the reserved test dataset to evaluate its performance.

Accuracy Score:

The accuracy score is calculated to measure the percentage of correct predictions by the model.
